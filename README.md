# Finite Field Arithmetic Calculator on FPGA

This project implements a **Finite Field Arithmetic Calculator** on an **FPGA (Cyclone IV)**, capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within a finite field. The design is optimized using **Hardware Description Language (HDL)** and synthesized for FPGA deployment.

## Features
- **Addition**: Implements addition within a finite field.
- **Subtraction**: Efficient subtraction algorithms.
- **Multiplication**: Supports multiplication in a finite field.
- **Division**: Implements finite field division.
- **Conversions**: Modules for ASCII, BCD, and binary conversions.
